# **WORDLE WEB APP**

## **Overview**

I have developed **Wordle**, a web application that is a word-guessing game where the user has to guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts.

## **About the Game**

Wordle is a word-guessing game where players attempt to find a hidden 5-letter word within a limited number of tries. After each guess, the game provides feedback by highlighting letters in different colors:

- **Green** â†’ Correct letter in the correct position
- **Yellow** â†’ Correct letter in the wrong position
- **Gray** â†’ Letter is not in the word

The objective is to use logical deduction and vocabulary skills to solve the word within the given attempts.

## **Tech Stack Used**
